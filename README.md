Hey! Welcome to my little corner of the internet, made for Hack Club's [personal site YSWS](https://page.hackclub.com) program.

This website is a personal website inspired by old-internet-themed search engines like [Wiby.me](https://wiby.me/), and serves as a break from today's overly polished and modern web design.
