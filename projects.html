        I definitely don't get to work on projects that often, but I've made some pretty cool things since joining Hack Club last January. :p

        I've listed some of my most recent projects below, albeit in no particular order.

        <h3>Captain Redbeard's Adventure</h3>
        Over the summer, I was trying to come up with projects to work on for Hack Club's Summer of Making, with the goal of wracking up enough hours to earn a 3D printer. 
        While brainstorming, the idea of creating a 2D classic-lego-pirate-themed platformer popped to mind and I was immediately hooked.
        
        <br><br>
        I absolutely loooved the browser-based Lego games of the 2010s, so I couldn't be more excited to make my own. This was my first time using Godot and it was as rewarding as it was challenging.
        <br><br>
        The final product was a 2D classic-lego-pirate-themed platformer heavily inspired by the 2D LEGO® platformers of the mid-2010s and the 1989-1997 LEGO® Pirates theme.

            <img src="images/redbeard3.gif" draggable="false">
        </div>
        <br>
        You can play it at <a class="link" href="https://alymakesstuff.itch.io/captain-redbeards-adventure" target="_blank">alymakesstuff.itch.io/captain-redbeards-adventure</a>!
        I'm super proud of how this turned out, especially for it being my first time using Godot. :D
        <br><br>
        
        <h3>Oops, I'm Innocent!</h3>
        For my next game that summer, I wanted to make a visual novel. Tiny issue... the thought of having to make game art terrified me (and still does). Luckily, my friend Z came to the rescue and made all the game's stunning visuals.
        <br><br>
        Together, we created <i>Oops, I'm Innocent!</i>, a darkly humorous visual novel and point-and-click adventure.
    
        <br><br>
        <div class="image-row">
            <img src="images/oops1.png" draggable="false">
            <img src="images/oops2.png" draggable="false">
            <img src="images/oops3.png" draggable="false">
            <img src="images/oops4.png" draggable="false">
        </div>
        <br>
        This game is genuinely <i>soooo</i> much fun to play, try it out at <a class="link" href="https://alymakesstuff.itch.io/oops-im-innocent" target="_blank">alymakesstuff.itch.io/oops-im-innocent</a>!
        <br><br>
        
        <h3>Fish_v1</h3>
        Created for Hack Club's Solder YSWS, this project was my intro to printed circuit boards (PCBs).
        <br><br>
        Using KiCAD, I created a fish-shaped keychain PCB, consisting of a super simple circuit that turns on an LED in dim light.

    
        <br><br>
        <div class="image-row">
            <img src="images/fish1.png" draggable="false">
            <img src="images/fish2.png" draggable="false">
            <img src="images/fish3.png" draggable="false">
            <img src="images/fish4.jpg" draggable="false">

        </div>
        <br>
        Hack Club then sent me an electronics kit and a $10 grant to order my PCB, which is so cool?! You can see my actual physical PCBs in one of the photos above!!!
        <br><br>

        <h3>My (old) personal webpage</h3>
        Over the summer, I also made a personal webpage. 
        This was my first real time working with html, css and javascript, but I made something I was definitely proud of at the time.  >:DD
        <br><br>
        Features include:
        <ul>
            <li>profile picture with buttons to change the theme of the photo</li>
            <li>moving clouds in the background, using css animations</li>
            <li>recent projects gallery</li>
            <li>terminal-style about section with working commands</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <div class="image-row">
            <img src="images/webpage.gif" draggable="false">
        </div>
        <br>
        The personal website you're on right now is <i>wayyy</i> cooler, buuuut you can explore my old one at <a class="link" href="https://6829ascs.github.io/personal-webpage/" target="_blank">https://6829ascs.github.io/personal-webpage/</a>.
        <br><br>
        I actually reused the clouds/sky/forest background from my old website somewhere on the website you're on rn!
        <br><br><br>

        <h1>Projects I'd like to work on next</h1>
        <h2>https://whatsnext.com/</h2>
        I'm not too sure what I'll make next, but I'd like to maybe:
        <ul>
            <li>make another game</li>
            <li>make a macropad</li>
            <li>make a pcb nfc card</li>
        </ul>
